## Problem Statement

### User Problem
Many learners, from middle school students to PhD professionals, struggle to manage study time efficiently and improve academic performance. While there are many online resources, they often do not match individual learning preferences, causing overwhelm and reduced productivity.

### Users
- Students from middle school to PhD.
- Professionals aiming to enhance academic or career productivity.

### User Tasks
- Create personalized study schedules.
- Set and track academic goals.
- Explore and utilize different study methods.
- Manage time effectively to balance study, rest, and other activities.
- Receive reminders for important tasks and deadlines.

## Final Design

TMPOE is a web application integrating features to enhance productivity and academic performance:

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean, minimalistic, and intuitive design.
- **Scheduling Tool**: Create and manage personalized study plans.
- **Goal-Setting**: Track and achieve academic milestones.
- **Notifications**: Timely reminders for tasks and deadlines.
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitor academic achievements over time.

### Redesign After User Testing
- Improved visibility of system status (form submission, data saving).
- Added clear logout and undo/redo options.
- Ensured consistent language and UI elements across the app.
- Error prevention mechanisms for correct data entry.

### Design Decisions
- **Interface Metaphors**: Familiar icons such as calendars for scheduling, bells for notifications.
- **User Feedback**: Indicators and confirmation messages for actions performed.

**Alternatives Considered:**
- Multiple interfaces for different user levels → Chose one customizable interface.
- Dark Mode → Postponed due to time constraints.

## Evaluation and User Testing

- **Paper Prototyping**: Identified need for simpler and intuitive layouts.
- **Heuristic Evaluation**: Highlighted consistency and error prevention issues.
- **User Testing**: Provided real-world insights and feedback for improving usability.

**Critical Incidents Observed:**
- Initial loading time was a concern.
- Goal-setting feature perceived as slightly complex.

**Remaining Usability Issues:**
- Occasional lag during use.
- More interactive tutorials needed for new users.

## Implementation Details

TMPOE is implemented as a web application with:

- **Frontend**: React for a responsive single-page application (SPA).
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: MongoDB for flexible and scalable data management.
- **Technologies Used**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, MongoDB.

**Key Implementation Decisions:**
- SPA ensures seamless user experience without full page reloads.
- NoSQL database to handle diverse data types efficiently.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Initial performance issues resolved via code refactoring.
- Limited testing time led to minor post-launch bugs.

## Lessons Learned & Future Improvements

- Importance of iterative design and user feedback for effective UI.
- Value of thorough testing at each stage to identify and fix problems early.

**What We Would Do Differently:**
- Start with more detailed wireframes and interactive prototypes.
- Conduct more user testing rounds with a larger, diverse user group.
- Focus on core feature refinement before adding new ones.
